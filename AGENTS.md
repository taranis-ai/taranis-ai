# AGENTS Instructions

This file is for coding agents that support `AGENTS.md`.

Shared repository conventions are maintained in [.github/copilot-instructions.md](.github/copilot-instructions.md) and should be treated as the primary source of truth for:

- environment and package management (`uv`)
- testing and linting commands
- development workflow rules

This file should only contain agent-specific deltas that are not appropriate for [.github/copilot-instructions.md](.github/copilot-instructions.md).
